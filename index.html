            <h2>Market validation</h2>
                <h3>Market validation is the process of presenting a concept for a product to its target    market and learn from those prospective buyers whether or not the idea is worth pursuing.

                    This process typically takes place early-on in the conception stage, before any significant investment has been made in developing the product.
                    
                    The two most common approaches to market validation are:
                    
                    Interview people in the target market, such as the buyer and user personas.
                    Send out surveys to these personas.
                    The key is that market validation research must include direct contact and feedback from people in the product’s intended market.

                                The first step in any good market validation plan includes a deep dive into the actual market.  We often default to assumptions, gut, and “I feel” statements. We consider our target market to be much too varied. To ascertain the real attributes of our target audience we work through a few exercises.

                                A value proposition should speak to the pain points of the target audience. For example, let’s look at Lyft. As it joined the shared-ride scene it needed a differentiator, a unique value proposition. Lyft needed something that set them apart from the competition.

                                    The last tier of the triangle prior to testing is UX. User experience is the visual culmination of everything discovered in the tiers beneath it. It is what we use to validate and test the value proposition and feature set created with the target audience’s unmet need in mind.

                                Testing is utilized to gather feedback from the user base about the validity of the product concept. Building an early, interactive design and putting it in front of test groups gives us invaluable information about what the product is doing well and what it might be lacking. Testing like this can take place in several different environments; 1:1 user interviews, living room style focus groups, and even user surveys can be great quantitative tools to measure engagement, preference, and perception.

        <h1>Understand the Core Value of Your Product</h1>
            <p>
            The core value of your product is the sum of all the benefits your product provides. It’s more than just the tactical solution your product can accomplish — it’s what that tactical solution is building toward in terms of overall goal attainment.
            </p>

            <article>
            <h1>Build a Story Around Your Product’s Core Value</h1>
                <p>
                Once you’ve fleshed out your product’s core value, show how that value looks in real life through a case study of how someone has experienced the value your product provides. 

                Your messaging should start by explaining why the prospect should buy a solution like yours. That’s conveyed through your product’s core value. Then you explain why they should buy your product specifically, which you explain by showing how your product’s features and benefits address the prospect’s pain points.

                <p>    
                Over time, interview your customers to ensure you're highlighting the value and benefits that they’re receiving and not misrepresenting your product. The things your customers are consistently talking about should be part of your messaging.

                            Marketing channels are the different types of content you use to create demand for your product and move potential customers down the marketing funnel. For example, social media, paid search ads, blogs, SEO content, and emails are different marketing channels. The marketing channels you choose depend on two things: your target audience, and where your potential customers are along their buyer’s journey.

                    The goal of your GTM strategy is to sell your product, so it’s essential to decide how you’ll sell to your target audience and turn prospective customers into buyers. That’s where your sales strategy comes in.

        <h1>Create clear processes</h1>
                <p>
                Creating a great go-to-market strategy is one thing, and executing it is another. That’s why creating clear processes is essential when bringing a product to market—because regardless of how well-crafted your strategy is, it only succeeds when you communicate and execute your strategy with your team. For example, you should consider the following when crafting your GTM strategy: 
                
                    How you’ll share your strategy and collaborate with team members.
                    How you’ll course-correct and track goals. 
                    How you can standardize processes with templates.
